The tribe has one of the highest percentage incidences of diabetes, and the dataset for this modelling was from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  The model built has the objective of predicting whether a patient has diabetes. Do note that all patients here are females of at least 21 years of age and are of Pima Indian heritage.  This dataset is also commonly used in many Data Science teaching materials, and you can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database). and it can also be found at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository]([https://archive.ics.uci.edu).\n",
