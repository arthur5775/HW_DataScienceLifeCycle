    "Why is it that when we start to learn a programming language, we introduce the basic data types?  Simply put, a data type tells the computer how to interpret its value.  For a data scientist, understanding data types ensures that the data collected and used is in the appropriate format and the representation of the value is as expected by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 basic data types in Python, which are:  \n",
    "* **Integers**: Whole numbers, with an accurate representation but the range is limited to the bit representation.  (As an aside, this can be used to represent octals and hexademicals as well).  \n",
    "* **Floating-Point Numbers**: Real numbers, however there is a trade-off with precision.  \n",
    "* **Complex Numbers**: A real and imaginary component, that cannot be represented using a real number.  \n",
    "* **Strings**: A sequence of characters, for example a phrase or word.  \n",
    "* **Boolean**: Represents two possible (binary) values, usually interpreted as True or False.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We are mainly concerned with Boolean, Integers, Floating-Point and Strings.  Let us start with the primitive data types. In programming, we name a storage area and call it a variable. For example, we may have a variable called <span style=\"color:red\">num</span> and we want to assign it an integer number of <span style=\"color:red\">4</span>.  \n",
    "num = 4  \n",
    "We have now successfully stored the integer number <span style=\"color:red\">4</span> in a storage (the computer memory) that we called <span style=\"color:red\">num</span>.  We can check for the type that we have by using the function <span style=\"color:red\">type</span>. (A function in programming is the same as a mathematical function where it is a sequence of instructions that performs a specific task that is packaged as a unit. This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task should be performed).  \n",
    "type(num)  \n",
    "We should get an output if we run the command above and it should tell us that it is an <span style=\"color:red\">int</span> (which stands for integer).  To ensure that we are all on the same page, on your Jupyter Notebook, you should have something that looks like below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![P2](picture/P2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the importance of understanding the data types, we will do a simple arithmetic addition by typing <span style=\"color:red\">num + 5</span>.  This should return the value <span style=\"color:red\">9</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's then try to assign a new real number (floating-point number)  to the variable named <span style=\"color:red\">fp</span>, i.e., <span style=\"color:red\">fp = 4.5</span>.  We then try to ask the computer to add a string <span style=\"color:red\">\"some\"</span> to it.  It will give us an error.  Before you conclude that the <span style=\"color:red\">'+'</span> sign is for arithmetic addition, it is also used for \"adding\" two parts of a string together, or concatenation of strings.  You can do this using <span style=\"color:red\">\"some\" + \"thing\"</span>  to get  <span style=\"color:red\">'something'</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python does allow integer and floating-point numbers to be mixed. This is because Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning that the Python interpreter is able to figure out that you are mixing them. It will then convert the type that can be a subset (in this case the integer) to the superset (in this case the floating-point) representation.  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">4.5 + 5</span>  \n",
    "or  \n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">num + fp</span>  \n",
    "This should give you an introduction to understanding data types and how it plays a role in handling data.  By now, you should have noticed the left side (In and Out) numbering on your Jupyter Notebook.  If you haven't figured out what it means, come to class and ask.  We will also have less illustrations here on Canvas lecture and tutorial notes from here forward as we expect you to be able to follow the notes from here on without it (and execute it on your own in your Jupyter Notebook)."

Generally, <span style=\"color:red\">list</span> and <span style=\"color:red\">disct</span> (dictionary) are useful for data science.  We have composite data types in order to store data in a commonly agreed upon data structure, which has certain useful functions built-in to the data types.  This means that we do not need to create a data structure each time we want to do some processing.\n",
    "\n",

The term item here means the value that is contained inside the list data structure. Lists (in Python) are defined by having the items between square brackets <span style=\"color:red\">[ ]</span>, i.e., <span style=\"color:red\">[3,4,6,2,3]</span> is a list of 5 integer items.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dictionary - A data structure in Python that stores items in key-value pairs. A key is an identifier for the value stored, and the value is the item associated with that key. Do note that dictionaries in Python are mutable, but they are not ordered.  Dictionaries are created using curly brackets (also known as braces) <span style=\"color:red\">{ }</span>. The key-value pairs within the dictionary are separated by commas (<span style=\"color:red\">,</span>), and within the key-value pairs, the key and value are separated by a colon (<span style=\"color:red\">:</span>), e.g., <span style=\"color:red\">{1:'apple', 2:'ball', 3:'carrot', 4:'doll'}</span>.  You may find this useful as a database format for data science purposes. (As an aside, there are databases such as MongoDB that store data in this format and this is also commonly represented in data exchange formats such as JSON).\n",

    "Now that we have introduced the data types that are commonly used in Python (we will introduce more, such as DataFrame later), we shall proceed to review (for most of  you anyway) programming. Programming can simply be considered as a sequence of instructions where there will be decisions to be made (conditions) and repetitive instructions (iterations).  When you think about it, this is similar to a (sad) person's working life where it's iterative on a daily basis until death; containing waking up, washing up, brushing teeth, getting dressed, having breakfast, catching the bus and so on.  Within it, there are decisions to be made, what to wear for the day, what to eat for breakfast and so on.  Hence, programming is not that much different from your daily life (even if you don't have a sad life!).  Let's look at conditions and iterations:"
